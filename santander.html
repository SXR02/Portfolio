      <h2>Client Problem</h2>
      <p> Santander first challenge was  identifying and developing talent within the company. Traditional methods 
        involved paper-based assessment carried out by the manager, which did not provide an objective assessment of the 
        individual performance, and remove any bias. The second challenge, Human Resources were unable to streamline the process to 
        ensure consistent standard of assessment would be carried out across the business, therefore require a method to managaging
        this centrally.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col span_1_of_2">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Within the team, we needed to establish the key prorities based on the client brief, to create an MVP.
        There were a few requirements we agreeed the app should cover within our ideation phase .</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Translate the paper based assesmment into a digital version, create user experience that is fluid and more streamlined</li>
              <li>To create new boards, and stored within a datatbase to reducing paper waste  </li>
              <li>To analyses the data by providing admistrative tools for Human Resources</li>
              <li>A peer to peer solution to reduce unconscious bias</li>

      <h2 style="color: white; margin-top: 20px">Ideation</h2>
      <p style="color: white;">The ideation was important from a design perspective to understand the potential content that would be required in order 
        to design the website application. There was some core area of focus such as the grid, required for the assessment, the users added to the 
        application, for business wide use and storage of data for HR to analyse the information. With this agreement, I could now progress with the 
        wireframing.

      <h2 style="color: white; margin-top: 20px";>Wireframing</h2>
      <p style="color: white"> Following on from the ideation phase of the project, I used paper-based wireframing to understand the layout,
          and elements that needed to feature within the app, to ensure it met the objective we had set out as a team. There was a few 
          iterations on potential screens, but the core emphasis was a login screen, grid screen and ability to add users. </p>

      <p style="color: white">The wireframing process helped identify  components, that made up each individual screen. This was important to understand, 
      how to build out components in relation to the design which would need to be reviewed and share with the team. Some of 
      those components were:</p>
      <ul style="color: white">
        <li>Navigation bar</li>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Placeholder</li>
        <li>Labels</li>
    </ul>
  <p style="color: white">The last image shows the  mock-up of the digital talent manager, specfically focusing on the grid, as a team  
    we believe this would achieve the client's MVP.

      <p style="color: white;"> The focus for this project was mainly front-end/backend software development, and given the project duration was only a week, there 
        was not a huge design element. I had moved to front-end development, as oppose to developing the high-fidelity wireframe, as we 
        needed a functional web application.  Below the sprint board was set up for daily tasks to be completed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Working in react, I began coding by working on the components, as they would be reusable within the application. This would 
    help efficiently create the design of the web application very quickly. </p>

 
<p>
Below we have the final version of the MVP which closely resembles the paper wireframe we were seeking to achieve.
