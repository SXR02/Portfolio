                  Through my experience during School of UX, I was able to develop 
                  further knowledge UX/UI knowledge which I applied to real-life scenarios. The below presentation details the key design 
                  process which focused on real project focus on event management Dasboard.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          During the last part of the course, it bought together the different elements of what I had learnt during the course to the final project. The final project involves a real client, with requirements and desire outcome, in this case events dashboard. 
          For me, it allowed me to complete a project, by going through each step, implementing the key learning all consolidated in the final project. 
          There were key considerations such as accessibility, and use flow, which I believe need to be consider before even design a solution or MVP. 
          I was able to double down, on the content layout, wireframing, building out the style guide and UI components. 
          The process of prototyping, allowed me to keep experimenting with variances and variables to produce a functional app. 
          The project demonstrate clear progress from the previous projects, continuous adding layers to skills and knowledge.
