                  Through my experience during School of UX, I was able to develop 
                  further knowledge UX/UI knowledge which I applied to real-life scenarios. The below presentation details the key design 
                  process which focused on creating a Miles & Miles mobile app.

       <h2>Background</h2>
       <p>During the second week of the course, Mile & Miles project was based on client brief, to create a mobile friendly application for luxury car rental business. 
        This project helps build on the first project, as now I needed to be able to confirm the brief, and requirements which would make the mobile application relevant and purposeful to their customers. 
        I used the client requirements, and balance that with what would be truly achievable within the app, as an MVP. 
        The user journey help identify both the screen flow and the necessary content from the main website, to help navigate the customer with the most relevant information and encourage the best possible outcome, a purchase.
        The design element was a big part of this project as I gained greater understanding with components and ensuring consistency within the whole design. 
        Overall, the key element here was making sure the app, would be complementary to the main website, to help reach wider demographic of customers.
        
        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>Developed a car hire app for Miles and Miles to streamline the car rental process, to reach out to a wider demographic, by 
          providing a user-friendly platform for customers to book, manage, 
          and return rental cars efficiently.</p>

        <h4>Business Requirement:</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong> Create a mobile application that simplifies the car hire process, reaches a wider customer demographic, and increases bookings. </p>
        <h6>Approach: </h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Conducted stakeholder meeting to gather business requirements and understand key objectives.</li>
        <li>Identified core functionalities needed for the app: user registration, car search, booking, payment processing, and rental management.</li>
        <li>Defined performance metrics for the app, such as increased booking rates, improved user retention, and higher customer satisfaction scores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong> Established clear business requirements and goals, ensuring the app would meet both user needs and business objectives.</p>
        
        <h4>User Journey:</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Map out the steps a user takes from downloading the app to completing a car rental, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.</p>
        <h6>Approach: </h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Developed user personas to represent different types of users (e.g., petrol heads, Eventer, Showstopper).</li>
        <li>Created detailed journey maps outlining each stage of the user experience, including login, car search, payment booking, pickup, and return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong> Provided a comprehensive user journey map that guided the design process, ensuring all user needs and expectations were met based 
          on the intial requirements.</p>

          <h4>Wireframing:</h4>
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Visualize the apps structure and layout to ensure intuitive navigation and functionality. </p>
          <h6>Approach:</h6>
          <ul>
          <li>Created low-fidelity wireframes using Figma to outline the app's basic structure and key elements. </li>
          <li>Focused on essential screens such as the home screen, car search results, booking process, user profile, and rental management. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Outcome: </strong>Produced a comprehensive set of wireframes that served as a blueprint for the app, ensuring a clear and intuitive user experience. </p>

          <h4>Visual Design: </h4>
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a visually appealing and brand-consistent interface that enhances the user experience.</p>
          <h6>Approach:</h6>
          <ul>
          <li>Used Figma to create high-fidelity mockups, incorporating Miles and Miles' branding elements such as colour scheme, typography, and logos. </li>
          <li>Focused on a clean, modern design with intuitive icons and buttons to facilitate easy interaction.</li>
          <li>Ensured consistency in visual design across all screens, maintaining a cohesive look and feel.</li>
