      <h2 style="color: white; margin: 5px;">Problem</h2>
      <p style="color: white;">The problem to solve for the group, was to encourage better tourism 
        within the city, to give better visisbility of Birmingham heritage and culture. There 
        was currently no specfic app that provided information in personalise experience. The desire outcome,
        tourists were are able to make the most of their visit, based on their location.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col span_1_of_2">
    <h2 style="margin: 5px;">Solution</h2>
    <p>A geo-fenced app which provides facts, places of interest, restaurants, entertainment, hidden gems, 
      and tourist information based on their current location. This would be information that would not 
    be obtained from competitors like e.g. google maps, because the information would be regularly updated,
    and unique information specfic to Birmingham.

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p> To create a solution, it was important to build a minimum viable product, this included, planning 
       what must, should and could be included within the app. From a design perspective, this 
       would be important to understand the content I would have to design around.

    <h2 style="color: white;  margin: 5px;">Requirements</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">To keep the MVP simple and achievable, 
      there were three key aspects as a group we agreed would achieve the set goal.</p>
    <ul style="color: white;" >
      <li>Login Page</li>
      <li>Map page </li>
      <li>Pop-up functionality, to indicate points of interest i.e. image, text and or AR feature</li>
    </ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Objective</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> To help the team, materialise the solution to the problem we were attempting to solve.

</div>
<h2>User Persona</h2>
<p>The user persona was a useful method in helping creating the potential users that would utilise the app. The key here, was not to 
  create a list of all users, but rather based on a survey and the data obtained, would help identify common 
  themes such as lifestyle, and key motivation as to why users would use the app. This would help identify whether we had captured the right 
  requirements for the app.
</p>

<h2>Wireframing process</h2>

<div class="section group">
	<div class="col span_1_of_2">
    <img style="width: 500px;"  src="assets/img/brumGo/wireframeDrawing.jpg" alt="paper based wireframing">
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_2">
	<p style="width: 450px; margin: 5px;" >From the initial planning, it was important to talk through and sketch out the user 
    flow and get understand the potential functionality of the app itself. I was able 
    to connect the potential information and the visual design to show the path between 
    the key pages. This helped identify any flaws we wouldn't have otherwise considered as part of initial plannning. The paper based wireframing 
  would prove to be very helpful, as collective would agree what the MVP could look like. </p>
	</div>

<div class="section group">
	<div class="col span_1_of_2">
    <p style="width: 450px; margin: 5px;"> My task was to translate the MVP, into high-fidelity wireframe. The 
      key was to remember the wireframe should be able to satisfy the early consumers and to provide feedback for furture product development.
      I used Figma, which was the go-to tool used mainly within the course, to draft an initial design of our app. 
      The design tool help me visualise the app to the team. It open up conversation, on whether our early assumptions needed to be challenged 
      and help me take on feedback to improve the design.</p>

    <img style="width: 500px;" src="assets/img/brumGo/figma.png" alt="high-fidelity wireframes using figma">
	</div>
</div>


<p> I shared the MVP developed in Figma with the team, which helped visualise app.  One potential improvement was to enhance the point of interests
  on the map itself. The screen on the left showed the basic intention to simply display in a list form, as this would satisfy the users. However, 
  one potential improvement from the team was to enhance the points of interests on the map itself. From a design perspective, I now improved the
  view  to focus on the map, with markers included, demonstrated on the right screen. I continued to iterate in this way with small improvements. </p>

    <h2>Coding </h2>
    <p>I was coding in react-native, which was mobile version of react. It was first time coding in react-native, and a 
        noticable challenge, was the styling. In React Native you don't  have CSS styling, you have JavaScript styling and often this meant I had to style inline rather 
        than what I was used to with CSS Modules. </p>

    <h2>Project Delivery</h2>
 
    <p>I worked in day sprints, making sure I had coded the component for the team to review and provide feedback before it would be
       pushed to main branch.  This helpful as a Zenhub helped organise the work breakdown structure, and commiting the code into Github </p>
