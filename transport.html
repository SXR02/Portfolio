                  Through my experience during School of UX, I was able to develop 
                  further knowledge UX/UI knowledge which I applied to real-life scenarios. The below presentation details the key design 
                  process which focused on Transport for London mobile website experience.

       <h2>Background</h2>
       <p>During the first week of the course, TFL was the first project assigned to work on using Figma. 
        The focus of the project was to think about the user experience by considering the following factors: accessibility, layout and components. 
        Here, I could review the following elements, and consider my own suggestions, as to how I could further improve the experience. 
        This project helped me particularly understand accessibility, comparing this to the current design and what I could do, to achieve better accessibility. 
        I began looking at report, I had decided the layout could be optimised, for the purpose of the mobile usage and the components were to become simplified to ensure the user was getting relevant information. 
        I improved the colour distinction between the background, title and components. 
        The key takeaway from this project was understanding the importance of accessibility, and building empathy for design at the start of any project.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>Redesigned the Transport for London (TFL) app to improve usability, enhance accessibility, and provide a more user-friendly experience for commuters navigating London's transportation system.</p>

        <h4>Business Research:</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong> Understand the needs of TFL and its users to ensure the redesigned app meets both business objectives and user expectations.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong> Developed a comprehensive understanding of business requirements and user needs, providing a solid foundation for the redesign process. </p>

        <h4>Design Review:</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong>Evaluate the existing app design to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.</p>
        <h6>Approach:</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Compiled findings into a design review report, highlighting key issues such as navigation difficulties, unclear information architecture, and accessibility barriers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong> Identified key areas for improvement and established a prioritized list of design changes to enhance user experience.</p>

        <h4>Content Design:</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong> Create clear, concise, and helpful content to guide users through the app and improve overall usability.</p>
        <h6>Approach:</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Simplified navigation labels and instructions to ensure clarity and reduce cognitive load.</li>
        <li>Developed microcopy for key interactions, such as journey planning, ticket purchasing, and service updates, providing context and guidance at each step. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong> Produced user-friendly content that enhanced navigation, improved comprehension, and provided a more intuitive app experience.</p>

        <h4>Wireframing: </h4>
        <p><strong> Objective: </strong> Visualize the structure and layout of the redesigned app to ensure intuitive navigation and functionality. </p>
        <h6>Approach: </h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Created low-fidelity wireframes using Figma to outline the app's basic structure and key elements.</li>
        <li>Focused on essential screens such as the home screen, journey planner, ticket purchase, service updates, and user profile.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong> Developed comprehensive wireframes that served as a blueprint for the app redesign, ensuring a user-centered layout and intuitive navigation.</p>
        
        <h4>Accessibility:</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong> Ensure the redesigned app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
        <h6>Approach:</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Adhered to WCAG 2.1 guidelines throughout the design process, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong>Delivered an inclusive app design that meets accessibility standards, ensuring a positive experience for user.</p>

        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong>Develop a visually appealing and brand-consistent interface that enhances the user experience.
        <h6></h6>Approach: </h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Used Figma to create high-fidelity mockups, incorporating TFL’s branding elements such as colour scheme, typography, and logos.</li>
        <li>Focused on a clean, modern design with intuitive icons and buttons to facilitate easy interaction. </li>
        <li>Ensured consistency in visual design across all screens, maintaining a cohesive look and feel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome: </strong>Delivered visual design that enhanced usability and aligned with the brand’s identity, providing an aesthetically pleasing and effective user experience.</li>
