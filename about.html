        <h3>Journey</h3>
        <p>My journey into UX/UI design began when I was working as Project Intern, where I learnt about the user experience, when working on student engagement platform. Without any key foundational knowledge of UX/UI, I went on to work with the developer to improve the aesthetics of the site, as well as improve the retention of student engaging with the platform. I realise the impact that intuitive and empathetic design can have enabling users to return to use the platform. The work I had undertook, both UX/UI help reduce the overall bounce back rate for new users, and existing users returning to use the platform throughout their education.
          It’s when I embarked on a software development bootcamp, where I encountered the terms UX/UI. I found myself focusing on design for a further two more project Santander, and BrumGo. Here, I worked with developers, closely creating designs and feeding back to the team. I enjoyed the process of brainstorming, creating, iteration, and building. This took me to keep developing my knowledge, using Coursa, Google UX modules, building a further project. When the opportunity presented itself, I couldn’t wait to start the School of UX bootcamp, working on a further 4 projects which further expanded my knowledge on user-centred, design principles, wireframing, and prototyping using tools like Figma.  Since then, I have continued, to read, watch and add various layers to my knowledge.
          </p>
          <h3>Extra</h3>
          <p>Outside of work, I’m deeply passionate about staying active and exploring the great outdoors, with hiking and adventurous activities being my go-to ways to keep fit and connect with nature. These adventures often lead me to discover new places, fuelling my love for traveling and experiencing diverse cultures. I have a deep appreciation for animals and love spending time visiting them, whether it's at wildlife reserves, zoos, or during my travels. My creative side is expressed through writing, where I weave the stories of my travels and adventures into narratives that capture the essence of the experiences around me.</p>        
          <h3>Final words</h3>
          <p>I'm eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue growing as a designer. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.</p>
